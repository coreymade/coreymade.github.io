      TrackR was in the midst of launching of the the tiniest tracking devices for your personal belongings. Unfortunately they didn’t have a user center way for users to do so. Mossio was tasked with redefining the TrackR brand, creating a beautiful easy to use mobile application and refresh the website.

      Mossio created a more approachable, effective brand. This was done carefully by executing current implemented branding models while focusing on a more clean, elegant look and combining the two. This ultimately led to more flexibility in creating a mobile experience that would connect with TrackR customers.
