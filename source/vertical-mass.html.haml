      The problem
    .divider
    %p
      The Vertical Mass platform literally has tons of data to communicate to their end users. Showing so much data points to a user in a way they can easily understand was the first hurdle that we had to jump. Adding value to this, was crafting an exceptional user interface that was beautiful, and easy to manuver around.

      The solution
    .divider
    %p
      Clearly communicating visual data in an elegant way was our top priority. We sifted through wireframe after wireframe, moodboard after moodboard to come up with a user interface that would provide users with a visually stimulating overview of their data at every point in the UI.
